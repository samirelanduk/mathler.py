# mathler.py

This is a Python, command line version of the online puzzle [mathler.com](https://mathler.com), which is itself a mathematical spin on the popular word game [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) (though not affiliated with either website in any way).

Run `mathler.py` and a 6 character equation will be generated. You have six guesses as to what it could be. Correct characters will be coloured in yellow. Correct characters in the correct location will be coloured in green.

You can run it as many times as you like, and there are no dependencies.
